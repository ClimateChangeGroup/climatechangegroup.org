                        <p class="text-left mt-2">Are you worried about the changes occurring to our climate, but avoid bringing up the topic? Are you afraid you might offend someone or get into an argument? Concerned you don’t know enough about the science behind climate change
                            to talk about it? Baffled by the fact that the science is clear, yet people continue to insist that either the climate is not changing or, if it is, that the changes are due to natural, as opposed to human, causes?</p>

                        <p class="text-left">Luckily, there is a lot of great research out there on how to raise the topic so that people will listen. And it does not require a vast knowledge of climatology.</p>

                        <p class="text-left">In our program, we take these climate change communication theories and turn them into practice, teaching you how to raise the issue of climate change comfortably and successfully.</p>

                        <p class="text-left">Our programs meet in person in the DC metro area, and are made up of three 2-hour meetings spread a week apart. We request a $20 donation per person to help defray expenses. For our TALK program, we focus on working with groups
                            of people who already know one another, such as college friends, sports teams, clubs, religious groups, etc. Working with an intact group fosters support and accountability, which will increase your level of success.</p>

                            interests, resources, time, etc. and help each person figure out what the best thing is for him or her to do.</p>

                        <p class="text-left">While Anne is newly attuned to the realities of climate change, she has always felt a deep commitment to her community, and has volunteered with local charities for children, veterans, and the elderly for the last twenty years.
                            She is a member of the Board of Directors for The Backpack Project, a non-profit organization dedicated to helping children in under-served areas of Washington, D.C.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-left">Her decision to expand her community efforts to include climate change was triggered by a class she recently took on Environmental Science at American University, which opened her eyes to the alarming effects of climate change.
                            This knowledge spurred her to get involved with fostering the discussion on climate change at Climate Change Group.

                        <p class="text-left">Fran spent many hours outdoors during her childhood in Maine. As the youngest of a large family, her love of the natural world was encouraged from a young age. This commitment continues in the work she does as the Assistant
                            Director of The Elements DC. Elements is a wintertime after-school enrichment program for young children whose primary goal is to connect them and their families to nature. </p>
                        <p class="text-left">Fran also has a strong belief in giving back to her community. Until June 2015 she served as Vice President of Programming on the Board of the Parents Council of Washington. Currently she is a tutor for Reading Partners in
                            the DC Public School System, and a Board Member and a high school mentor with City Kids Wilderness Project, which provides enriching life experiences for under-resourced DC youth.</p>
                        <p class="text-left">Both her career and volunteer work emphasize fostering communication and developing programs that allow people to grow. She realized she could take the skills used with these groups – non-confrontational communication, patience,
                            strong listening abilities - and apply them to help people talk about climate change.</p>

                        <h2>Meet Tory Ruttenberg</h2>
                        <hr class="star-primary">
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-xs-12 col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2">
                        <p class="text-left">Tory’s fascination with environmental issues began in high school, where her favorite class was environmental chemistry. She majored in American Studies with a focus on Environmental Studies at Yale and then went on to practice
                            environmental law for several years. Most importantly, many of her best memories are of times she has spent in wild natural places.</p>

                        <p class="text-left">Since 1997, Tory has worked as a management consultant, focusing on coaching, facilitation, organizational development, and conflict resolution (<a href="http://www.ruttenbergconsulting.com">ruttenbergconsulting.com</a>).
                            While she cared about the environment, she hadn’t focused on taking action. That changed when she read Bill McKibbon’s book, <em>Eaarth</em>, a couple of years ago.</p>
                        <p class="text-left"><em>Eaarth</em> fascinated, horrified, and scared her. It also rang true and made her realize that it was time for her to act. But she had no idea what to do. Finally, she realized she could combine her interest in working
                            on climate change with her experience as a coach and facilitator, so she, Fran, and Anne started ClimateChangeGroup.org.</p>
