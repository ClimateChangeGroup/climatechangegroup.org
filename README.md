## Development tools ##
 1. [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) server
 2. [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) package management
 2. [Webpack](webpack.github.io) bundling

## Commands ##
 1. `yarn start` - run Webpack in development mode with live reload
 2. `yarn build` - run Webpack in production mode with output to `/docs`
 3. `yarn lint` - lint against [airbnb style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
 4. `yarn run clean` - clean the build directory

## Project setup ##

index.js is the entry point and all dependencies are specified there. index.html is the main template.

The project uses [PurifyCSS](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/purifycss-webpack). CSS classes that are added dynamically must be added to the whitelist in `webpack.config.js`.

## Deployment ##

The site is hosted using Github Pages. The `/docs` folder is the entry point. Anything you commit to the `master` branch is *live*.

## Notes ##
Do not edit anything in `/docs` directly. It's all generated by `yarn build`.

This project uses [image-webpack-loader](https://github.com/tcoopman/image-webpack-loader) for image minifcation. You may need to install libpng for this to work. You can do that using homebrew with this command: `brew install libpng`.
